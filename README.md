PySeidon
================

### Project description ###
* This project aims to meet multiple objectives of the EcoEII consortium
  through the setting of a dedicated server and the development of Python
  based packages. This project can be seen as two folded. On the one 
  hand, it aims to enhance data accessibility for all the partners of 
  the EcoEII consortium thanks to simple client protocols. On the other 
  hand, it aims to develop standardised numerical toolbox gathering 
  specific analysis functions for measured and simulated data (FVCOM model)
  to the EcoEII partners.
* Additionally, this project was the ideal opportunity to transport various
  scripts and packages accumulated over the years into Python. These scripts
  and packages have been extensively used by the tidal energy community for
  more than a decade. The 'Contributors' section of this document is a 
  mere attempt to acknowledge the work of those who participated more or
  less indirectly to the development of this tool box. We are consciously
  standing on the shoulders of a multitude giants...so please forgive us
  if we forgot one of them.  
* The present package is currently in Beta testing, so the more feedback,
  the better
