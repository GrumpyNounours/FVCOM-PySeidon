aimet/

aimet_add.m: Calculates asymmetry parameter a and standard deviation of angles on each direction
aimet_drhodx.m: Calculate drho/dx after reading in u and v (would also want other derivatives on other grids)
aimet_ha.m: Perform harmonic analysis using t_tide on a time series, ts.
aimet_kpd.m: Calculate kinetic power density after calculating speed in aimet_s.
aimet_pbias.m: Metric pbias, the bias of the mean power toward ebb or flood tide.
aimet_power.m: Calculate electrical power after calculating speed in aimet_s.
aimet_preal.m: Calculate actual electrical power based on turbine efficiency and cut-in and rated speeds.
aimet_sbias.m: Metric sbias, the bias of the mean speed toward ebb or flood tide.
aimet_shear.m: Calculate shear after reading in u and v.
aimet_s.m: Calculate speed after reading in u and v
aimet_ss.m: Calculate signed speed from principal axis values. This gives the wrong direction for flows in eddy fields.
aimet_theta.m: Calculate angle between vertical velocity and horizontal speed.
aimet_top.m: Calculate turbine operation time.
aimet_vort.m: Calculate vertical vorticity after reading in u and v.

principal_axis.m: From Brian Polagye's code.
